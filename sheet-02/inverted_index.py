        Construct the inverted index from the given file. The expected format
        of the file is one document per line, in the format
        <title>TAB<description>. Each entry in the inverted list associated to
        a word should contain a document id and a BM25 score. Compute the BM25
        scores as follows:

        (1) In a first pass, compute the inverted lists with tf scores (that
            is the number of occurrences of the word within the <title> and the
            <description> of a document). Further, compute the document length
            (DL) for each document (that is the number of words in the <title>
            and the <description> of a document). Afterwards, compute the
            average document length (AVDL).
        (2) In a second pass, iterate each inverted list and replace the tf
            scores by BM25 scores, defined as:
            BM25 = tf * (k+1) / (k * (1 - b + b * DL/AVDL) + tf) * log2(N/df),
            where N is the total number of documents and df is the number of
            documents that contains the word.

        On reading the file, use UTF-8 as the standard encoding. To split the
        texts into words, use the method introduced in the lecture. Make sure
        that you ignore empty words.
