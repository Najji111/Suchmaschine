Experience: Using the Lagrange for exercise 2 was not easy. We could't find the right condition. The same goes for exercise 3.
Invested time for the sheet was 9h.

We hope to see more explanations at the sheet which can really help as to understand how to proof und how to process our solutions.
It will be much better if we get programming exercises and theory one at the same sheet, so that we understand more using programming.  

for the question "Why do most computer scientists have terrible handwriting?"
i think this theory could be right if we change ("computer scientists" to "doctors") :)
