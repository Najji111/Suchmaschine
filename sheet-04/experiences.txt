The Exercise Sheet 4 took about 8 hours of work. The Exercise 1 was quite ok, but also i'm not really fit in Lagrange. (About 4 h)
The Exercise 2 was really hard for me. This part of the exercise was explained at the lecture very quick, and i did not really check it. (About 4 h)

About math phobia:
i did not have any mathe phobia in my life, till i started the computer science.
Of course i can do the maths, but i always find big problems, trying to connect math with theory to proof something. 

it will be too much better, if you try to explain more at the Exercise Sheets or give as more Keys to orient our solves.
