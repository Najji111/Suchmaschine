The difference of the old inverted_index and the new one ist huge. The old one is much faster than the new.
Specially the l2-norme is not way to slow.

Using scipy and numpy is not easy. It is not so intuitive to use. The auto converting is not smooth. 
But it helps a lot to "fast" implement math operations.
